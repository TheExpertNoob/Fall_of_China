# The Collapse: July 7th, 2027
*An excerpt from a post-apocalyptic account of the Fall of China*

**Date:** July 7th, 2027  
**Location:** Former Shanghai Free Trade Zone

**10:07 AM CST**  
The sky was gray, but that wasn’t new. What was new was the *silence*. The kind of silence you don’t notice until the background hum of a trillion circuits, screens, fans, and feeds disappears. 

Phones died first. Then power flickered. Then nothing.

By 10:10, every digital screen in the Zone had gone black. Not crashed. Not frozen. Just blank, like the city itself had blinked and forgotten what it was.

**10:25 AM**  
Jiang tried to use his company ID to get into the underground shelter beneath Building 8. The lock beeped red. No access. His boss was nowhere. The office? Empty. Messages stuck on "Sending..."

A girl near the entrance was crying. She said she saw a drone fall out of the sky. Not crash. Just... *stop flying*.

**11:02 AM**  
The loudspeakers crackled alive. Just static. A minute later, a male voice came through:

> "...All citizens, remain in your zones. Do not attempt to contact central authorities. Martial law is in effect. Repeat: Do not..."

Then silence again.

By noon, the markets—once pristine storefronts glowing with endless LED light—were already being ransacked. Not out of greed. Out of fear. No one knew if the food trucks were coming tomorrow. Or if tomorrow existed.

**Day +1**  
Rumors spread faster than power could be restored. "The Party is gone." "Beijing is glass." "The generals have turned on each other." People started printing fake ration coupons. The smart ones began hoarding batteries and rice.

**Day +3**  
No trucks. No planes. No signal. A man with a satellite phone said Guangdong had declared independence. That Shenzhen was forming its own council. The border with Hong Kong was now guarded by armed civilians wearing mixed uniforms.

**Day +7**  
We started marking time by sunrises.

Storefronts were stripped bare. Some boarded up. Others burned. A golden-lit mall that once sold imported Italian handbags had been turned into a barter camp. You could trade a watch for five eggs if you were lucky.

Jiang watched a kid offer a handful of old coins for bottled water. The vendor looked at him with pity and walked away.

**One Month Later**  
The word "China" had stopped being used. People spoke in provinces. In blocks. In factions.

Shanghai became a city-state in all but name. It was run by a coalition of ex-tech CEOs, cyber defense units, and one charismatic woman named Chen Yu who had once written propaganda speeches for the central government.

**Three Months Later**  
We found out the blackout had started at the Central Communications Hub in Beijing. Explosion? EMP? Coup? No one knew.

All we knew was this:

**July 7th, 2027**, was the day the Red Dragon stopped breathing.

The silence that followed wasn't peace.

It was the sound of a world waking up to the end of commerce.
